    <h2 class="h3">Who is {{ site_title({ url: false }) }}?</h2>

    <h3 class="h5" id="contact--paul-craig">Paul Craig, Developer</h3>

    <p>My name is <a href="https://pcraig.ca/" target="_blank">Paul</a> and I barely ever thought about groundhogs until I discovered my girlfriend <a href="https://rhianna.ca/" target="_blank">Rhianna</a>’s local groundhog, <a href="/groundhogs/balzac-billy">Balzac Billy</a>, is just an fully-grown adult in a sports mascot costume(!!!). So I started Googling around and was astonished at the incredible variety of groundhog prognosticators. At the same time, the data was just a mess — commonly, groundhogs do not employ a sysadmin at all.</p>
    <p>In addition to building the site + API, I have accidentally become maybe one of the foremost Groundhog Day experts in Canada slash the world. To inquire about keynote speaking at your conference or even just to say hi, email me at <span class="email--swap" data-email="cGF1bEBncm91bmRob2ctZGF5LmNvbQ==">“paul [a] groundhog-day [dot] com”</span>.</p>

    <p><strong>Favourite groundhog</strong>: I really like <a href="/groundhogs/lucy-the-lobster">Lucy the Lobster</a> from Nova Scotia. Amazing headgear.

    <p><a href="https://www.tylerbenning.com" target="_blank">Tyler</a> is a super talented Designer extraordinaire who agreed to help come up with some groundhog-mocks between surfing the Altantic, couchsurfing Vancouver, and getting a real job. If there’s some aspect of the design you don’t like, it’s probably when I didn’t take his advice.</p>
