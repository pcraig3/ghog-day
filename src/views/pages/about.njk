    <p>Groundhog Day is a lighthearted holiday celebrated annually across North America in which ‘prognosticating’ animals predict the onset of spring.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, on February 2nd, <a href="/groundhogs">various groundhogs</a> across North America are consulted by local public figures (often a mayor) for an annual weather prediction:</p>
    <ul class="with-bullets">
      <li>If the groundhog ‘sees its shadow’, it means 6 more weeks of winter</li>
      <li>If the groundhog doesn’t see its shadow, spring will come early</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Since groundhogs can’t speak English, they communicate their ‘prognostication’ in ‘<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/groundhogese" target="_blank">Groundhogese</a>’ — a language known only to specially-ordained groundhogs and the presiding officiant.</p>
    <p><a href="/groundhogs/punxsutawney-phil">Punxatawney Phil</a> is the most famous prognosticating groundhog, largely due to starring the 1993 Hollywood film “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/" target="_blank">Groundhog Day</a>,” with Bill Murray in a supporting role. However, there are many Groundhog Day ceremonies across North America, not always strictly including a live groundhog, but all of which follow the central premise of an animal predicting the upcoming weather.</p>
    <p>So that’s Groundhog Day in a nutshell. However, if you’re a curious person or you’re not yet 100% clear on the scientific method used by groundhog forecasters, I would direct you to <a href="/history-of-groundhog-day">a more comprehensive history of Groundhog Day</a>. It’s just as weird as you think.</p>
